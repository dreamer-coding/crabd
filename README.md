# **crabd** ‚Äî Blue Crab Daemon

`crabd` is the central daemon responsible for hosting and managing CrabDB instances across the network. It runs as a background service, responding to commands issued by tools like `crabctl`, and provides endpoints for database synchronization, remote querying, health monitoring, and system orchestration. On startup, `crabd` loads its configuration from a TOML file, which defines server settings, security policies, node relationships, and database paths. It supports running in the foreground for debugging or as a daemon for production environments. With built-in support for SSH-based authentication, token-based security, and IP allowlists, `crabd` ensures secure communication between nodes. It listens for incoming connections, processes commands, and handles lifecycle operations such as initialization, configuration deployment, and log streaming. Its modular architecture enables clean integration with metrics collection, automation scripts, and distributed control, making it the backbone of the CrabDB infrastructure.
